To run the program, compile the C code with a C compiler.

To input the different variables, go to line 493 of init, where simulator variables are initiated.
The variables can also be inputted while running by commenting out the variables and commenting in the scans I have provided.

The messages will be outputted in an output file, while the simulation messaged will print in the program on run.
